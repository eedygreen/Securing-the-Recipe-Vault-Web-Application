Remediation Plan

1. Remediation of ssh bruteforce

    1. The IAM policy 
    The policy should follow the List privilege principle. Define the role specific for each \
    IAM user/instance. This will limit the scope/action a user/instance can perform on the system/network.
    In any case that the IAM acess key is exposed, the user/instance will inherit only limited action,
    and there will be minimal damage.

    2. Security Group (Rule) for inbound connection. 
    SSH Inbound Rule should be configured on the Security Group to only allow connection from an 
    instance within the security group.

    3. Server-Client Authentication
    Setup Server-Client Authentication, this will ensure only users who successfully proved who they are
    will be given connection access. 

    4. Network Controls - Subnet and Network Blocks
    Sources of connection should be explicit configured with specific range. Use my Ip only, i.e
    192.168.10.226/32

2. Remediation Plan for S3 Bucket Secret Recipe

    1. Bucket Policy & Access Point
    Bucket Policy and Access Point should be used to grant access to only authorised users
    These two can block IAM users and restrict VPC, thereby isolating specific users and Virtual Private Cloud. 
    Doing this will ensure the integrity of the file stored on the S3 Bucket.

    2. Enryption of the File while on-premise and Enable Server-Side Encryption with AWS-KMS
    Encypting the file "secret_recipe.txt" before uploading it unto the Bucket would prevent the confidentiality
    of the sensitive data.
