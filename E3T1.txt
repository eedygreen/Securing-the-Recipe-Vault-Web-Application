Task 1

1. GuardDuty Findings
"i-0fab66ab523772a93 is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.226. Brute \
force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password"
GurdDuty detected ssh bruteforce attack on instance-id i-0fab66ab523772a93.

3. GuardDuty as a Threat Intelligence application detect the Bruteforce attack on port 22 by
simply monitoring traffic, in this case the EC2 instance "i-0fab66ab523772a93" against the 
target host "10.192.10.226". It actively enagegd on continuous monitoring and analyzing workload event 
data found in CloudTrail, Logs, DNS, and VPC Flow Logs.

GuardDuty detected the attack from EC2 instance "i-0fab66ab523772a93" while monitoring the ssh port 22.
The findings revealed an ssh connection from unknown port 39852, i.e the EC2 instance "i-0fab66ab523772a93" 
has made an unauthorized ssh connection from local port 39852 to the target host "10.192.10.226" port 22. 
GuardDuty analyzed the VPC flow logs of the target host "10.192.10.226" and detected there was no 
supression rule "connection" for the port 39852. Gaurduty also analyzed the constant password probing 
for the ssh connection on target host "10.192.10.226". The numerous attempt futher proved that the
instance "i-0fab66ab523772a93" tried multiple combinations of incorrect login detailes, otherwise 
known as Bruteforce attack.
