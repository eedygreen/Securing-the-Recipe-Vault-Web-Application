Poor Security Practices

1. Absence of Least Privilege caused Excessive Permisions on S3 Bucket
The IAM role assigned to S3 Bucket give full access to all resources.
The is not the best practice as it does not followed the principle of Least Previlige.

2. Secuirty Group Ip Protocol & Network Cidr Block
The Web Server allows all type of connetions from all Protocols and IP addresses.
The Security Group does not addresses the connection from only secure trusted Groups of Ip addresses and Protocols.
